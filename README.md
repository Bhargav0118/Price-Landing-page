# Landing-page
In this project, HTML is used to define the structure of the landing page, including sections such as a header, hero section, features section, testimonials section, and footer. Each section contains appropriate content, such as product images, descriptions, benefits, customer reviews, and calls-to-action (CTAs).

CSS is employed to enhance the visual appeal of the landing page by styling elements such as fonts, colors, backgrounds, margins, padding, borders, and layout. CSS techniques like flexbox and grid layout are often used to create responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes and devices, ensuring a consistent and enjoyable browsing experience for users across desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

Additionally, we used JavaScript code  to enhance the product landing page by enabling currency conversion functionality. Upon page load (DOMContentLoaded event), it selects all elements with the class .price which represent the prices of products. It also selects a button element with the id change-currency-btn.The code defines two functions: convertToUSD() and convertToINR(). These functions convert the displayed prices between Indian Rupees (INR) and United States Dollars (USD) based on a predefined conversion rate (1 INR = 0.014 USD).

Overall, the product landing page project demonstrates proficiency in HTML and CSS for creating visually appealing and user-friendly webpages that effectively promote and market a product or service to potential customers.
